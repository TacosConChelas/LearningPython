Exercise 3 â€” Intersection of Multiple Lists

Given a list of lists of integers (e.g., [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [2,5]]), return a sorted list of 
integers that appear in all lists (the intersection).
Goal: efficient for many lists and large sizes.

Hint: Convert the first list to a set and iteratively intersect with set() of each 
following list using .intersection_update() or &=.

    Return the sorted intersection of all sublists.
