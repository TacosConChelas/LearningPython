Exercise --- 1 --- Simple Shape ABC
    Create an abstract base class called Shape with two abstract methods: area() and perimeter(). 
    Then implement concrete subclasses Rectangle and Circle. 
    Write a small script that creates a list of mixed shapes and prints each shape’s area and perimeter.
Hints
    Use from abc import ABC, abstractmethod.
    Remember math.pi for the circle calculations.
